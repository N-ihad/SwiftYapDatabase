# Swift-YapDatabase with SQLCipher support

[YapDatabase](https://github.com/yapstudios/YapDatabase), converted to a Swift Package.

See the [accompanying blog](https://www.vanille.de/blog/2020-spmifying-yapdatabase/) post for why and how I did that.

Discussion happens in the [YapDatabase issue tracker](https://github.com/yapstudios/YapDatabase/issues/497).
